# NYC-Sales-Ratio-Studies

# Goal of Project

This project seeks to determine if DOF's property appraisals meet the standards set by the International Association of Assessing Officers (IAAO). Using property sales and assessment data, it estimates the assessment-sale ratio and use it to measure how close DOF's market values are to true market value (sale prices). Additionally, the project evaluates how uniform the assessment-sales ratio are across the City and within groups by calculating the coefficient of dispersion.
